excerpt: 'Proximity-based interactions underlie applications such as
retail payments using smartphone-apps like Apple Pay and
Google Wallet, automated grocery store checkout, and vehicular transactions for toll payments. In these applications,
a transaction takes place between two objects when they
come close to each other, with relative proximity determining the pairing. In this paper, we present a new approach to
enable highly accurate pairing of vehicles to specific lanes
in a wide-range of vehicle-based multi-lane service stations
using general-purpose commodity communication and sensing technology. To evaluate its performance, we consider an
example application of pairing vehicles to respective quality check bays in an automobile manufacturing plant. Our
proposed system called Soft-Swipe works by matching natural signatures (specifically, motion signatures) generated by
the target object with the same signature detected by simple
instrumentation of the environment (a video camera or an inexpensive sensor array). Soft-Swipe implemented in a vehicle testing station performed pairing with median F-score of
96% using vision-only system, 92% using sensor-only system and, 99% using both'
