excerpt: 'Dashboard camera installations are becoming increasingly common
due to various Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based
services provided by them. Though deployed primarily for crash
recordings, calibrating these cameras can allow them to measure
real-world distances, which can enable a broad spectrum of ADAS
applications such as lane-detection, safe driving distance estimation,
collision prediction, and collision prevention. Today, dashboard
camera calibration is a tediousmanual process that requires a trained
professional who needs to use a known pattern (e.g., chessboardlike)
at a calibrated distance. In this paper, we propose SmartDash-
Cam, a system for automatic and live calibration of dashboard cameras
which always ensures highly accurate calibration values. Smart-
DashCam leverages collecting images of a large number of vehicles
appearing in front of the camera and using their coarse geometric
shapes to derive the calibration parameters. In sharp contrast to
the manual process we are proposing the use of a large amount of
data and machine learning techniques to arrive at calibration accuracies
that are comparable to the manual process. SmartDashCam
implemented using commodity dashboard cameras estimates realworld
distances with mean errors of 5.7 % which closely rivals the
4.1% mean error obtained from traditional manual calibration using
known patterns.'
