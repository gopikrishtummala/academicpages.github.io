title: "AutoCalib: Automatic traffic Camera Calibration at Scale"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-03-01-AutoCalib
excerpt: 'Emerging smart cities are typically equipped with thousands of outdoor cameras. However, these cameras
are usually not calibrated, i.e., information such as their precise mounting height and orientation is not
available. Calibrating these cameras allows measurement of real-world distances from the video, thereby,
enabling a wide range of novel applications such as identifying speeding vehicles, and city road planning.
Unfortunately, robust camera calibration is a manual process today and is not scalable. In this paper, we
propose AutoCalib, a system for scalable, automatic calibration of traffic cameras. AutoCalib exploits deep
learning to extract selected key-point features from car images in the video and uses a novel filtering and
aggregation algorithm to automatically produce a robust estimate of the camera calibration parameters from
just hundreds of samples.We have implemented AutoCalib as a service on Azure that takes in a video segment
and computes the camera calibration parameters. Using video from real-world traffic cameras, we show that
AutoCalib is able to estimate real-world distances with an error of less than 12%.'
