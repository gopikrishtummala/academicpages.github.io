excerpt: 'Inter-vehicular communication (IVC) can be used to enhance the sensing region of vehicles for improved safety on
the roads. For many applications based on IVC, the relative locations and communication identities (e.g., IP addresses)
of other collaborating vehicles are important for accurate identification. This is particularly challenging to achieve
in the presence of legacy vehicles which may not have any sensing or IVC capabilities. We present a system called
RoadMap, that matches IP addresses with respective vehicles observed through a camera. It assumes a smartphone
or a dashboard camera deployed in vehicles, to identify the vehicles in field of view (FoV), and IVC capability. It runs
in the adopted vehicles and accurately matches information obtained through multiple sensing modalities (e.g., visual
and electronic). RoadMap matches the motion-trajectories of vehicles observed from the dash-board camera with the
motion-trajectories transmitted by other vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, RoadMap is the first work to explore
motion-trajectories of vehicles observed from a camera to create a map of vehicles by smartly fusing electronic and
visual information. It has low hardware requirement and is designed to work in low adoption rate scenarios. Through
real-world experiments and simulations, RoadMap matches IP-Addresses with camera observed vehicles with a median
matching precision of 80%, which is 20% improvement compared to existing schemes.'
