Smart-devices can render high quality location services when
endowed with the ability to analyze information conveyed
through video feed. In this paper, we aim to provide tracking services by using a mobile smart camera such as in google
glasses and smartphones considering the following three objectives: (1) No additional deployment, (2) No user-side
instrumentation or hardware upgrades, and (3) Easy adoption in practice. Existing RF or VLC based solutions for
indoor tracking can provide location and orientation only
when there are dense deployments of APs or VLC bulbs
(anchor points) in user’s field of view. Vision-Track is the
first vision based solution that can track the camera’s location and orientation indoors even when no anchor point is
in line-of-sight (LOS). Vision-Track deployed in an indoor
college building provides a median localization accuracy of
49 cm.
